``MissMecha`` is developed by Youran Zhou as part of her PhD research at Deakin University, Australia.

Youran Zhou 
------------------

Youran is a PhD candidate in the School of Information Technology at **Deakin University**, with a research focus on **generative models**, **incomplete data**, and **machine learning**.

She holds a BSc and MSc in **Data Science** from the **University of Melbourne**, where her studies combined **Statistics** and **Computer Science**. Her academic background allows her to bridge **statistical rigor** and **computational efficiency** in practical algorithm design.

MissMecha was born out of her frustration with the lack of flexible tools for simulating and evaluating structured missing data. The package now supports:
- MCAR, MAR, MNAR mechanism simulation
- Multiple subtypes per mechanism
- Column-wise & global configuration
- Imputation evaluation modules

Echo is passionate about **open-source tools**, **education**, and **supporting diversity in STEM**. She has 6+ years of experience in data science and AI and has worked as a tutor for over 5 years.
